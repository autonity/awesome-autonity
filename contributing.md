# Contribution Guidelines

This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By engaging with this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Add an entry to this list

For an entry to be added to this list, the entry must be:

- awesome;
- seen as awesome by **two or more** community members (as evidenced by comments on your [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)); and
- directly relevant the Autonity project.

To add an entry to the list, you should:

- submit a PR with your entry added to [`readme.md`](readme.md) under what you believe to be the appropriate category;
- using correctly formatted markdown, like `- [<entry description>](<entry url>)` (a dash, a single space and the markdown link); and
- include a few sentences in your PR explaining why you think the resource is awesome and relevant to this list.

## Propose that an existing entry is removed

Not every entry is timelessly awesome. Perhaps an entry loses its awesomeness by becoming out-of-date, or perhaps an entry duplicates the essential information of a subsequently added, more awesome entry. Whatever the reason, if you think there's a good reason to remove an entry, you should:

- submit a PR with the entry removed from [`readme.md`](readme.md); and
- include a few sentences in your PR explaining why the entry is no longer awesome and should be removed.

The entry will be removed if:

- **five or more** community members (as evidenced by comments on your PR) agree that the entry should be removed.

Note: there is no stigma attached to the removal of an entry; it was once awesome so will forever be an _exceptional_ resource on the internet :)

## Reorganise entries

Entries are organised under top-level categories (i.e., lines prefixed with a single `#`). Unless there proves to be a compelling reason to add sub-categories, there will be only a **single, top-level** categorisation of entries. (A compelling reason could be something like: categories under a top-level category make-up a natural and exhaustive _taxonomy_.)

Categorisation is rarely fixed forever. As entries grow, the organisation of the entries will need to change from time-to-time. Some _reorganisation events_ are:

- add a new category;
- rename an existing category to something more accurate; 
- break up an existing category into two or more more detailed categories (or, if there's good reason, sub-categories); 
- move an entry under a more appropriate category;

If you believe entries should be reorganised, you should:

- submit a PR with your proposed reoganisation;
- make sure your PR contains only a single reorganisation event per commit (and consistently describe the event in your commit messages);
- include a few sentences in your PR explaining why you think your reorganisation proposal improves the current state of the list.

## Guidelines for _authors_ of entries

If you are _authoring_ the awesome entry you want added to this list, please consider publishing your content on [ipfs](https://ipfs.tech/). This is [easy to do](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/single-page-website/#host-a-single-page-website-on-ipfs) and Autonity community members will pin all ifps links in this list so that it is always available.
